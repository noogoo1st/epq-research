## Choosing an aerofoil
first understanding [[thin aerofoil theory]] to get a better understanding of the most basic aerofoil, before choosing a more suitable more complex one is a great idea.

I learnt from thin aerofoil theory that there is usually no lift at 0 <span STYLE="color:#f859f3;font-weight:bold" title = "angle of attack (applied relative to direction of travel)">A.O.T</span>, but some cambered aerofoils can produce lift even when A.O.T is 0, by directing air down using their shape
The formula for these aerofoils become $\text{lift coefficient} = c_0 + 2\pi\alpha$ where $c_0$ is the amount of lift at A.O.T = 0

This extra lift at 0 A.O.T is sure to help a [[glider]] function
