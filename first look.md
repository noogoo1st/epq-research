aerofoils are used in more than just fixed wing aircraft, should limit research to that area
many different geometries
[[angle of attack]] is very important
lift vs drag curves useful for determining efficiency

some terminology:
leading edge
trailing edge
chord line: straight line connecting leading and trailing edges
mean camber line: locus of points equidistant from upper and lower surface

thickness measures in 2 ways:
American convention: thickness in relation to camber line
British convention: thickness in relation to chord line

[[thin airfoil theory]] should be looked into
