there are 2 catagories: open catagory and specific catagory
my plane will fall under the open catagory and is subject to hobby flying laws

flying a plane above 250g (c0) requires a licence and i estimate my plane to be between 0.5 and 2 kg in the end.

drone classes
c0 <250g, <42mph, include toys and harmless drones. no licence required
c1 <900g, <42mph, must have a licence to fly for this and all below
c2 <4kg, must have a low speed mode (<3m/s)
c3 <25kg, have automation on board for control
c4 <25kg, have little to no automisation on board

you must register to fly a drone(flyer ID), its free and requires you to take a theory test. it good for 5 years.
the drone must also have an operator above the age of 18 who is responisble for the drone. it costs Â£9 to be an operator
I am not 18 so will need my parents to do this

drones below 20kg do not need any insurance.

for any drones above 250g, or that have a camera, an operator id is required to be able to fly it.
only drones that are >250g require a flyer id, irrespecitive of wether it has a camera.

point 2: the drone must always be in direct line of sight when flying,
no using binoculars or electronic equipment to see it
You are allowed to have an observer to help you when fying:
you must always be able to talk to them while they keep looking at the drone
you are still responsible for safety
if flying fpv there must be an observer present

point 3:
