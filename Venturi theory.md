#### Venturi theory
airspeed above aerofoil is faster because there is a constriction of the flow and so there is lower pressure
__why is it wrong?__
- theory is based on [[Venturi effect|Venturi]] nozzle, but there is no other half for the nozzle to exist
- it does not predict the lift of a flat plate. flow slows down at negative angle of attack(aot), the opposite of the expected from the nozzle model
- it neglects the lower surface
- using [[Bernoulli's equation]] to obtain pressure is correct, but the venture assumption provides the wrong velocity values
