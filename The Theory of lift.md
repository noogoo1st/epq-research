## The real theory of lift
This theory of lift must be able to (and does) account for the fact that lift can be generated from a variety of shapes, including: aerofoils, flat plates, spinning cylinders, etc.
seeing as lift is a **force** it is plain to see that $F = ma$ which that $F = m\frac{dV}{dt}$ 
since $V$ has both a **magnitude** and **direction** changing either of these will change the force
This means that lift can be generated from just the turning of the flow in another direction
- flat plates *redirect* air downwards
- aerofoils do that, and *change the speed*
- a spinning cylinder will wrap air around it and push it down
- etc.

#### in summary
- the force on a body is from the [[aerodynamic forces|fluid pressure]] around it
- the fluid pressure comes from the change in velocity of the fluid around the surface
- the change in velocity comes from the flow turning described above
