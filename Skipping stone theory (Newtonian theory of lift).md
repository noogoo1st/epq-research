#### skipping stone theory (Newtonian theory of lift)
simple newtons third law: the air hitting the bottom of the aerofoil pushes it up
__why is it wrong?__
1. it neglects the top surface, and assumes all lift is generated by the lower. this is clearly not the case, as the top surface also deflects the flow
2. doesn't predict negative lift
3. making predictions based on air density gives incorrect answers, lift is generated by deflecting fluid
however for high speed low density conditions (space shuttle's early re-entry) this theory is very accurate. but this only applies in super specific circumstances
