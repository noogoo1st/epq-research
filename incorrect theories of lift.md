most caused by **specifying velocity wrong**
see [[The Theory of lift]]

#### Venturi theory
airspeed above aerofoil is faster because there is a constriction of the flow and so there is lower pressure
__why is it wrong?__
- theory is based on Venturi nozzle, but there is no other half for the nozzle to exist
- it does not predict the lift of a flat plate. flow slows down at negative angle of attack(aot), the opposite of the expected from the nozzle model
- it neglects the lower surface
- using [[Bernoulli's equation]] to obtain pressure is correct, but the venture assumption provides the wrong velocity values

#### skipping stone theory (Newtonian theory of lift)
simple newtons third law: the air hitting the bottom of the aerofoil pushes it up
__why is it wrong?__
1. it neglects the top surface, and assumes all lift is generated by the lower. this is clearly not the case, as the top surface also deflects the flow
2. doesn't predict negative lift
3. making predictions based on air density gives incorrect answers, lift is generated by deflecting fluid
however for high speed low density conditions (space shuttle's early re-entry) this theory is very accurate. but this only applies in super specific circumstances

#### longer path/equal transit theory
upper surface is longer than lower surface
particles must travel this distance in the same time & must therefore travel faster
this faster speed and [[Bernoulli's equation]] mean there is less pressure on top, generating lift
__why is it wrong?__
1. symmetric aerofoils still create lift, as well as modern aerofoils where the lower surface is longer than the top
2. doesn't explain how airplanes can fly upside-down
3. it is an incorrect assumption that the particles must meet up again at the rear of the aerofoil, this actually causes the velocity of the particles to be too slow and the calculated lift is lower than experimental lift.
