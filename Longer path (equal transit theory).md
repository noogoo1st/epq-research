#### longer path/equal transit theory
upper surface is longer than lower surface
particles must travel this distance in the same time & must therefore travel faster
this faster speed and [[Bernoulli's equation]] mean there is less pressure on top, generating lift
__why is it wrong?__
1. symmetric aerofoils still create lift, as well as modern aerofoils where the lower surface is longer than the top
2. doesn't explain how airplanes can fly upside-down
3. it is an incorrect assumption that the particles must meet up again at the rear of the aerofoil, this actually causes the velocity of the particles to be too slow and the calculated lift is lower than experimental lift.
