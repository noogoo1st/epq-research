## Bernoulli's equation

This shows just one of many forms of the equation, though likely the most common/most useful.
It is important to remember that the **total pressure** is a constant when the other restrictions are met, as this allows one to equate different parts of the flow to figure out variables
The main thrust of this equation is to say
> when the *velocity* of a flow increases, the *pressure* decreases
> (at least on low velocity flow where density stays constant)

This is the method behind which the [[Venturi effect]] works.
It is also [[static pressure]] not [[dynamic pressure]] that is important for the [[aerodynamic forces|calculation of lift]]
