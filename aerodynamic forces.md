aero pressure forces act perpendicular to surface
$$\vec{F} = \sum{p\vec{n}}\Delta A$$

$$\vec{F} = \oint{P\vec{n}}\,dA$$

$$lift = L = \vec{F}_{normal}$$

$$Drag = D = \vec{F}_{streamwise}$$
$$\begin{where}
\Delta a &= \text{the area being calculated}
\end{where}$$

seems I don't really have to worry about the contour integral, the first formula should suffice for numerical analysis.

if pressure is constant all around the surface, the net force is 0
pressure acts normal to a surface

lower right graph shows variation in pressure across chord length
the variation occurs because of the difference in speed of the fluid in motion
{speed is directly linked to pressure (research area: Bernoulli's/Venturi's equation)}

component of force perpendicular to direction of flow is called lift, parallel is called drag
[[Bernoulli's equation]] can be used to calculate pressure when no boundary layers are present. and [[The Theory of lift]] describes this effect
