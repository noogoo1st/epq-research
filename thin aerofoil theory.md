## Thin aerofoil theory
Used only to analyse **thin** aerofoils *(aerofoils that are infinitely thin and have no camber, or shape to them.)*
Demonstrates *3* important factors:
- The <span STYLE="color:#f859f3;font-weight:bold" title = "the point that pressure forces act through, like the centre of gravity">centre of pressure</span> and [[aerodynamic centre]] are coincident and exactly $\frac{1}{4}$ from the leading edge along the chord.
- [[Choosing an aerofoil|cambered aerofoils]] have the [[aerodynamic centre]] at the same location, but the <span STYLE="color:#f859f3;font-weight:bold" title = "the point that pressure forces act through, like the centre of gravity">centre of pressure</span> moves with angle of attack.
- $\text{lift coefficient} = 2\pi\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the angle of attack of the aerofoil in *radians*.

This theory doesn't account for stalling, but since I don't expect my glider to exceed large angles of attack, I don't think this will be an issue
